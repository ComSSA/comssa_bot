# ComSSA Bot

This is the latest and greatest ComSSA Open-Source Discord Bot.

It is designed to be built with much more solid development practices from the beginning, and be open and available to anybody to view the source code, and contribute to the development if they'd like.

We hope to be able to create an example of good development practices, with Unit Testing, and automated Testing and Deployment using Docker.
